# ContigNet: Phage-bacteria contig interaction prediction with convolutional neural network

Version: 1.0

Authors: Tianqi Tang, Shengwei Hou, Jed Fuhrman, Fengzhu Sun

Maintainer: Tianqi Tang tianqit@usc.edu

## Description

ContigNet is a deep learning based software for phage-host contig interaction prediction.
Traditional methods can work on contigs however the performance is poor. 
Existing Deep learning based methods are not able to solve the particular question regarding interaction prediction between two contigs.

## Dependencies

## Installation

To use the software, download and enter the repository by
``` bash
git clone https://github.com/tianqitang1/ContigNet
cd ContigNet
```

To install required dependencies a [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) installation is required. After a conda distribution is installed, create and activate a ```conda``` virtual environment with the following commands
 ``` bash
 conda create --name ContigNet --file requirements.txt
 conda activate ContigNet
 ```


## Usage

### Test new contigs

### Feature extractor mode
